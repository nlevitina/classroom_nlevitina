/*3, Based on 2, perform an OLAP operation: slice. 
In comment, describe how you perform the slicing, i.e. 
what do you do to what dimension(s)? Why is it a operation of slicing?*/

/*3 answer:
Slicing is selecting a part of a cube (database) using value for one of a cube's dimentions. 
In this case it should be done using the 'where clause's value, i.e. year 2006. As a result the cube still has data 
relevant to 2006 available in all the tables available.*/

/*4, Based on 2, perform an OLAP operation: drill-down. 
In comment, describe how you perform the drill-down, 
i.e. what do you do to what dimension(s)? Why is it a operation of drilling-down?*/

/*4 answer:
Drill-down is an opertion of narrowing down results going from a summary to  a more detailed view.
In this case I would drill down using the 'order by' categories: first view the data by quarter, 
then by Category or Business type (alternatively, first view by quarter, then by Business Type, then by Category).
